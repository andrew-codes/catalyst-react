**This is very much so a work in progress**, so the blog engine does not currently fully realize this readme; however, for the goals of this project and for future reference:

Catalyst is a customizable, fully isomorphic blog written from the ground-up in ES2015 and React, along with a variety of other front-end technologies. It uses Koa as its server and includes hot-reloading when in development mode.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start # runs blog in production mode with defaults
```

## Customizing Blog

```bash
npm run dev # runs blog in development mode
```
